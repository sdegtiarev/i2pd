Build Statuses
---------------

- Linux x64      - [![Build Status](https://jenkins.nordcloud.no/buildStatus/icon?job=i2pd-linux)](https://jenkins.nordcloud.no/job/i2pd-linux/)
- Linux ARM      - Too be added
- Mac OS X       - Too be added
- Microsoft VC13 - Too be added


Testing
-------

First, build it.

* $ cd i2pd
* $ make

Next, find out your public ip. (find it for example at http://www.whatismyip.com/)

Then, run it with:

$ ./i2p --host=YOUR_PUBLIC_IP

The client should now reseed by itself.

To visit an I2P page, you need to find the b32 address of your destination.
After that, go to the webconsole and add it behind the url. (Remove http:// and b32.i2p from the address)

This should resulting in for example:
http://localhost:7070/4oes3rlgrpbkmzv4lqcfili23h3cvpwslqcfjlk6vvguxyggspwa
